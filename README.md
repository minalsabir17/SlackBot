## Setup

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.7+
2. Reddit API credentials
3. Slack webhook URL
4. OpenAI API key (optional, for AI overviews)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
   ```
   SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL
   SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token-here  # For reading reactions
   SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-your-app-token-here  # For socket mode
   REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_reddit_client_id
   REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_reddit_client_secret
   REDDIT_USER_AGENT=Reddit Scraper 1.0
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here  # Optional
   ```

### Slack App Setup

For reaction-based AI overviews, you need to create a Slack app with the following:

1. **Bot Token Scopes**: `chat:write`, `reactions:read`, `channels:history`
2. **Event Subscriptions**: Enable and subscribe to `reaction_added` event
3. **Socket Mode**: Enable for real-time events

### Configuration

- **FETCH_INTERVAL**: How often to check for new posts (default: 60 seconds)
- **SUBMISSION_LIMIT**: Number of recent posts to scan (default: 25)

## Usage

Run the bot:
```bash
python bot.py
```

The bot will:
1. Monitor r/jerseycity for new posts and comments
2. Check content against political keywords
3. Generate AI overviews for large posts (if OpenAI is configured)
4. Send formatted messages to your Slack channel

## AI Overview Feature

The bot now supports **reaction-based AI overviews**:

1. When the bot posts a Reddit message to Slack
2. React to the message with the ðŸ¤– robot emoji
3. The bot generates a 2-3 sentence AI summary and posts it as a thread reply
4. Summaries focus on key political points, candidates mentioned, and main issues

**Requirements**:
- OpenAI API key (for generating summaries)
- Slack Bot Token and App Token (for reading reactions)
- Proper Slack app permissions and event subscriptions

**Note**: If OpenAI or Slack interactive features aren't configured, the bot will function normally as a basic Reddit monitor.

## Architecture

The bot uses a producer-consumer pattern:
- **Producer thread**: Fetches new Reddit content
- **Consumer thread**: Processes queue and sends to Slack
- **Thread-safe queue**: Manages communication between threads
